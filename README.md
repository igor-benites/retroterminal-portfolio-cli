# üñ•Ô∏è Portfolio Terminal Website

Welcome to my **Portfolio Terminal Website**! This project is a unique and interactive way to showcase my professional experience, skills, and projects through a **terminal-inspired user interface**. Designed to replicate the look and feel of an old-school command-line interface, this project combines creativity and cutting-edge technology.

## üìù **How It Works**
1. **Terminal-Style Navigation**:
   - Users can navigate through the portfolio by entering commands such as:
     - `about` ‚Äì Learn more about me.
     - `skills` ‚Äì Display my technical skills.
     - `experience` ‚Äì Show my professional experience.
     - `projects` ‚Äì View details of my completed projects.
     - `contact` ‚Äì Display my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email.
     ### Navigation & Command History
      - **Arrow Keys (‚Üë and ‚Üì):** Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through your command history, making it easier to re-execute previously typed commands.
      - **Tab Key:** Use the tab key to auto-complete commands (if applicable).

2. **Chatbot Integration**:
   - An AI chatbot provides responses based on the commands entered by the user. It is trained to answer questions about my background, avoiding sensitive topics.

3. **Backend API**:
   - The backend processes commands via API endpoints, fetches data from structured JSON files, and returns the appropriate responses.

4. **API Documentation**:
   - Swagger is available at `/swagger` to view and test API endpoints.
